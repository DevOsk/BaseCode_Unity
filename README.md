BASE CODE is a framework to develop games with all the “not a game components” already pre-configured and ready to use them out of the box.


I use BASE CODE as a foundation to our games, and we wanted to share it with you, maybe it could help you to speed up your journey to create amazing games.


We try our best to have everything documented, code organized, well commented with first class standards, and we will continue to develop and update this package when we develop a new module or functionality, since we use it ourselves, we are confident we can use your feedback to grow this package.
